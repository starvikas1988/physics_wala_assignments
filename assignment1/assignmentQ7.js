// Q7. You are building a weather application. Write a JavaScript program that takes the current temperature
// as input and uses the conditional (ternary) operator to determine and print the weather condition. If the
// temperature is above 30Â°C, the condition is "Hot"; otherwise, it is "Moderate"

function determineWeatherCondition(temperature) {
    const weatherCondition = temperature > 30 ? "Hot" : "Moderate";
    console.log(`The weather condition is ${weatherCondition}.`);
}

// Example usage:
const enteredTemperature = 31
determineWeatherCondition(enteredTemperature);
